### Description

Superceded by this submission

http://www.planet-source-code.com/vb/scripts/showcode.asp?txtCodeId=51403&lngWId=1

Updated 3/07 - Just minor stuff --- My cSuperClass submission's download link appears broken so I thought it was about time I made a new entry. Just as Vlad Vissoultchev's excellent subclasser built on mine and added a hooking thunk, I've done likewise and added timer and api-windows thunks.

Each of the thunks has an individual sample to demonstrate its use.

If you're blessed with Windows 2000 or Windows XP check out the form shadow/fade user control.

Thanks to Clint LaFever for the idea of a form shadow.
