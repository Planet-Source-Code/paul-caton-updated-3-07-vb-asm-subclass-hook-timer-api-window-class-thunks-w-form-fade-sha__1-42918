First register the type library
	Type Lib\WinSubHook.tlb

	One way to do this is to run the following project...
	Type Lib\RegTlb.vbp

Check out the sample projects
	Samples\ApiWindow\prjApiWindow.vbp
	Samples\Hooker\prjHooker.vbp
	Samples\Shadow\prjShadow.vbp
	Samples\ShadowCtl\prjShadowCtl.vbp
	Samples\Subclass\prjSubclass.vbp
	Samples\Timer\prjTimer.vbp

If you need a WinSubHook thunk in your project just add the appropriate file...
	Thunks\cHook.cls	- Windows hooks
	Thunks\cSubclass.cls	- Window subclasser
	Thunks\cTimer.cls	- Formless timer
	Thunks\cWindow.cls	- API Window
		
Add a reference to this Type Library...
	"Window/Subclass/Hook/Timer interface 1.5"

Or from the Project\References dialog 'Browse' to this file
	Type Lib\WinSubHook.tlb

Note: Type libraries are NOT required to execute a compiled application.
	
In a Form, Class or UserControl in your project implement the appropriate interface
	Implements WinSubHook.iHook 
	Implements WinSubHook.iSubclass
	Implements WinSubHook.iTimer
	Implements WinSubHook.iWindow	
	
The assembler models used can be viewed here...
	Asm\Hook.asm 
	Asm\Subclass.asm
	Asm\Timer.asm
	Asm\Window.asm

If you wish to experiment with the included assembler you can download all the tools required for free from http://www.masm32.com
